# Workflow
1. I've never played roulette before and I did not know the rules. Therefore, the first step was to read a few webpages about the rules of roulette.
1. I played other roulette games.
1. I coded roulette logic with unit test, not related to Unity project.
1. Implemented UI element by element.
1. Test

# How I have dealt with specific problems along the way 
1. Problem: How to test if score is calculated correctly?  
I didn't want to test and calculate it manually, so first thing I did was to create unit tests.

1. Problem: A lot of bet fields  
There are a lot of fields where player can place a chip, so I created small Unity Editor script to pre-generate game objects for me, it saved a lot of time.
